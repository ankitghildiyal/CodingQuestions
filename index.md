Repository has solution to some of the common coding questions asked in
interview. A lot of them are from the book 'Cracking The Coding Interview',
from LeetCode or questions that I have been asked in my interviews.
The repository is still in its initial phase and if I deliver my pledge
I would contribute more often to it.
